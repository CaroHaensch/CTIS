## The package

This package offers an R interface for the APIs connected to the Global COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey, formerly known as COVID-19 World Symptoms Survey.

## The Global COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey

The University of Maryland Social Data Science Center Global COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey, in partnership with Facebook, is available in 56 languages. A representative sample of Facebook users is invited on a daily basis to report on topics including, for example, symptoms, social distancing behavior, vaccine acceptance, mental health issues, and financial constraints. Facebook provides weights to reduce nonresponse and coverage bias. 

Data for the United States is not included in the Global COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey but is available at covidcast.cmu.edu.

## Open Data and Microdata API

Country and region-level statistics are published daily via the opendata API [2] and dashboards, and microdata is available for researchers via data use agreements. Over half a million responses are collected daily. For more information on the data, see https://covidmap.umd.edu/. While the open data is available without an account, the microdata API requires an account that can be requested here: https://dataforgood.fb.com/docs/covid-19-symptom-survey-request-for-data-access/.

## Working example 

### Install and load the package

As a first step, we install and load the package. At the moment, the package is only on Github, but we also plan to publish it on CRAN.

```{r setup}
# Installation (required only once)
# remotes::install_github("CaroHaensch/CTIS")

# Loading (always required)
library(CTIS)
```

### Check availability

We will first check for which dates data is available for a specific country.

```{r}
CTIS_Germany_available_dates <- CTIS_available_country(country = "Germany")

# Number of available dates
nrow(CTIS_Germany_available_dates)

# Some example dates
head(CTIS_Germany_available_dates)
```

We can do the same check (available dates) for specific regions in a country. Compared to the country names (in English), the names for the regions are usually specified in the native language. As an example, we check the available dates for the region Bavaria ("Bayern") in Germany. 

```{r}
CTIS_Bavaria_available_dates <- CTIS_available_region(country = "Germany",
                                                      region = "Bayern")

# Number of available dates
nrow(CTIS_Bavaria_available_dates)

# Some example dates
head(CTIS_Bavaria_available_dates)

```

### Load data from the Open Data API


As already mentioned, country and region-level statistics are published daily  via the opendata API [2] and dashboards.

A full list of indicators is available here:
https://gisumd.github.io/COVID-19-API-Documentation/docs/indicators/indicators.html

We will look up the indicator Vaccine Acceptance for three dates in May 2021 for Germany. We obtain different weighted and unweighted point and variance estimates.

```{r}
CTIS_open_data_country(indicator = "vaccine_acpt", 
                       type = "daily", 
                       country = "Germany",
                       daterange = "20210501-20210503")
```
Again, we can also receive data for a specific region in a country. 

```{r}
CTIS_open_data_region(indicator = "vaccine_acpt", 
                       type = "daily", 
                       country = "Germany",
                       region = "Bayern",
                       daterange = "20210501-20210503")

```
### Microdata API

While the open data is available without an account,  the microdata API requires an account that can be requested here by researchers: https://dataforgood.fb.com/docs/covid-19-symptom-survey-request-for-data-access/

The following function can then be used to download, save as a .csv and load all at once the microdata for a specific date. 

```{r}
username <- "Specify your username here."
password <- "Specify your password here."

# Once you have received access, uncomment the following lines
# and specify the date for which you wish to receive the microdata.

# CTIS_microdata(username = username, 
#               password = password, 
#               date = "YYYY-MM-DD")

```

And that's it. We thank the University of Maryland and the Facebook team for providing us with this fantastic data source! We also want to note that we used the tutorials provided on the https://covidmap.umd.edu/ site to create the core of the functions.
